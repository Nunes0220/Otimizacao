🎯 Sobre o Projeto
This project presents a machine learning approach to improving the identification of delinquent clients in a car loan company. Based on a real dataset of customer profiles and financial behavior, the work involves developing classification models capable of predicting credit risk more accurately. The analysis includes a detailed exploration of the data, followed by model training using cross-validation techniques to ensure generalization. To evaluate performance, we use key classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we interpret confusion matrices and ROC curves to better understand the strengths and limitations of the models.
